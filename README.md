# maxwell-particle

## About

maxwell-paraticle extracts particle velocities from a Maxwell distribution 
and plots the velocity distribution as probability function. 
Particles (listed below), temperature as electron volts, and the number of particles are required.
A theoretical Maxwell distribution is also plotted.

## Requirements

- python
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
